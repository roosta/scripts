# ### [install-packages.sh](./install-packages.sh)
#
# Install packages from YAML configuration using paru. Will look for
# `~/.dependencies.yml` unless `[config.yml]` is provided.
#
# Requirements:
# - https://github.com/morganamilo/paru
# - https://github.com/kislyuk/yq
# - https://archlinux.org/
#
# Usage:
# ```sh
# ./install-packages.sh [config.yml]
# ```
#
# Example configuration:
# ```yml
# packages:
#   # Core system utilities
#   core:
#     - name: cryptsetup
#       description: Userspace setup tool for transparent encryption of block devices using dm-crypt
#       aur: false
#     - name: git
#       description: The fast distributed version control system
#       aur: false
#   # ...
# ```
#
# For a full example of config refer to my [dotfile
# dependencies](https://github.com/roosta/dotfiles/blob/f40a9dbbab2e721d9ec63dd2f51be55701faf5ba/.dependencies.yml)
